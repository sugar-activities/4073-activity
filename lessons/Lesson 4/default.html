<b><u>Lesson 4: Create a Poem with the Story Builder</u></b>

<p><i>Note:  You can do this activity alone, or with a partner.</i></p>

<p><b>An image that inspires feelings can also inspire a poem.</b> Try to create or capture a strong image (something you find very beautiful or ugly), then write a poem to go with it.</p>

<ol>

<p><li><b>Paint a picture with "Paint" or take a photo with the "Camera"</b> on your XO laptop.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Open the MaMaMedia Activity Center</b> from the XO Home screen.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Open the Story Builder</b> from the MaMaMedia Activity Center.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Add your drawing or photo to the Story Builder</b> by using the "Add My Background" button.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Write your title of your poem and the words in the text boxes.</b> Remember that you want to create a ‘word picture’ for readers.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Save your poem.</b></li></p>

<p><li><b>Read your poem aloud to the class</b> and listen to the poems your classmates have written.</li></p>

<p><li>After someone reads their poem, <b>classmates should describe the image that comes to mind.</b> This will give each writer an opportunity to see whether or not their words were descriptive enough.</li></p>
