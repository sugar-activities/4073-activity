<b><u>Story Builder Lesson 5:  Creating Stories on the Story Builder with Dialogue</u></b>

<p><b>"Dialogue" is another word for talking.</b> When you tell a whole story by having the characters in it talk to each other, you are writing dialogue.</b></p>

<p>Movies, television shows and plays tell stories using dialogue. Think of a favorite movie (or television show or play). Who is your favorite character? Do you remember something that character said?</p>

<p><b>Try writing words for the characters in a story of your own.</b></p>

<p><i>Note:  You can do this activity alone, or with a partner.</i></p>

<ol>

<p><li><b>Open the MaMaMedia Activity Center</b> from the XO Home screen.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Open the Story Builder</b> from the MaMaMedia Activity Center.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Create a story by picking the background and the characters.</b></li></p>

<p><li>As you look at the scene, <b>think about what the character or characters might say.</b> What is the story behind this picture?  Where are they?  What is happening?</li></p>

<p><li><b>Act out this scene with your partner.</b> You can be one character and your partner can be the other.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Write down what each character says in the text box.</b> Remember to include the story elements (setting, characters, problem, resolution.)</li></p>

<p><li><b>Save what you have written</b> by clicking the SAVE button.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Share your story and picture with your class.</b> Read the dialogue aloud with your partner.</li></p>

<p><li><b>After everyone reads their story, discuss these questions:</b> How does the dialogue change the story? How is dialogue different from a story narrator describing a schene?</li></p>

<p><li><b>Have one student take notes from this discussion</b> on his or her XO laptop.</li></p>
