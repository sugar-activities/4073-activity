<b><u>Lesson 1: What is a Story?</u></b>
<ol>

<p><li><b>Tell a favorite story to your class.</b>  You can also use a picture book if one is accessible.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Take time to illustrate/draw the story that has been told or read.</b>  Use whatever you have to draw with -- paper, sand and a stick, or the Paint program on the XO Laptop.  Once you have completed your drawings, explain what you have drawn.</li></p>

<p><li>Every story contains these elements:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Setting</b> (the place where a story happens)</li>
  <li><b>Characters</b> (the people or creatures in the story)</li>
  <li><b>Problem</b> (the issue that the characters must face)</li>
  <li><b>Resolution</b> (how the characters handle the problem, and what happens to them as a result.)</li>
  </ul>
</li></p>

<p><li><b>Identify each of these elements in the story that you just read/told.</b></li></p>

<p><li><b>Now Brainstorm a list of interesting settings</b> (i.e. home, the beach, school, church</li></p>

<p><li><b>Brainstorm a list of interesting characters</b> (i.e. princess, monster, child, teacher)</li></p>

<p><li><b>Brainstorm ideas about problems and resolutions.</b>  Think of problems or resolutions that have come up in stories you know, or that have come up in your life or imagination.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Record all of these ideas to spark your imagination for new stories.</b>  Use the Write program on the XO laptop. Create a chart or on poster paper to hang in the classroom.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Act out a story based on selected story elements.</b> Pick a setting, a few characters, a problem and a resolution from the lists you created. Allow volunteers from the class to act out a story from this. Just make it up as you go along.</li></p>
