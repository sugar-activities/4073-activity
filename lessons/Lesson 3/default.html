<b><u>Lesson 3: What is Poetry?</u></b>

<ol>

<p><li><b>Ask your class if they know what a poem is.</b> Ask if anyone can name or recite any poems.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Talk to your class about the ways that poetry is different from stories.</b> (You may want to make a list on paper or using WRITE on the XO):
  <ul>
  <li>Poetry creates a mood or emotion</li>
  <li>The words in a poem often sounds beautiful and descriptive</li>
  <li>Poetry doesn't need to tell a story or use the story elements (setting, characters, problem, resolution)</li>
  <li>Poems can be just a few lines long, or many pages</li>
  <li>Poems don't need to make sense</li>
  <li>Poems don't need proper punctuation or grammar</li>
  <li>Poems sometimes rhyme but they don't have to</li>
  </ul>
</li></p>

<p><li><b>Share a poem with your class.</b> It can be one of your own favorites, or you can use the following example.<br><br>
(Note: First you may want to explain that a "sparrow" is a small brown bird and "change" means coins in your pocket.)<br><br>
<i>
Spill by Judith Thurman<br>
<br>
the wind scatters<br>
a flock of sparrow -<br>
a handful of small change<br>
spilled suddenly<br>
from the clouds' pockets.
</i>
</li></p>

<p><li>Before you read aloud, <b>ask the class to close their eyes and focus on pictures that appear in their minds.</b></li></p>

<p><li>After you read the poem, <b>ask the class to draw the pictures that appeared in their minds using the Paint program</b> on the XO Laptop.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Look at each other's pictures</b> and discuss how each one relates to the poem.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Encourage the class to read more poems.</b> Look for a book of poetry to share or try to find a site with more poems online.</li></p>
